# Landing Page Project
## This task required coding a multi-section landing page. This scenario replicates what, often times, occurs whereas it is unknown how much content will be added to a given page through a Content Management System (CMS) and/or an API.

### To circumvent this variable, it is possible to dynamically add the content to the webpage. Herein, this process was demonstrated via the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation menu is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which is an integral part of working with JavaScript frameworks.

#### To improve the overall, user-experience, the section actively being viewed is differentiated in some way. Additionally, when an end-user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls to the appropriate section rather than just offering the default (page) jump.
