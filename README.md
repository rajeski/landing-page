# Landing Page Project
You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API.
To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu.
Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you
begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a
navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
